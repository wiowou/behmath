- Want to be able to create volume blocks using 6 or 8 keypoints IN ANY ORDER
- lines must be created with those keypoints beforehand
- areas will be created underneath

- only volumes have raw pointers to nodes because only they will be meshed
- structured mesh volumes will hold the nodes and elements in multidimensional arrays
- swept volumes will hold the element faces to be swept in a 2D array
- unstructured volumes will simply have a 1D vector of nodes and elements
- volumes will be distinguished by whether each type of storage item is empty or full
- the mesh method must be provided a global vector of node pointers
eg
void Mesh(std::vector<Node*> n, ...);

within the mesh method, new nodes will be created and the pointers will be stored in the vector.
these vectors will be responsible for deleting these pointers when the program ends.
