# math
This project is currently a loose collection of numerical methods algorithms written in C++. It represents much of the work done in a mechanical engineering course in numerical methods. The hope is to expand this project in hopes of expanding the learning experience beyond the bounds imposed by the short duration of the course. It is felt that a better appreciation for computer science may result from this pursuit as well. Broadly, the algorithms cover basic:

  solutions to linear systems of equations
  root finding
  interpolation
  numerical integration of ODE's

# notes
CMake has been used extensively in this project. The CMakeLists.txt files are not polished. Much work can be done to improve the unit tests, especially along the lines of coverage. The basics are, however, in place.
